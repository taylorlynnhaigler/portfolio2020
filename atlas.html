          <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>The client was looking to create a cloud storage platform that
              would serve as a specialized hub for its users.</p>
            <p>Before developing, they were seeking to determine a target audience,
              develop a vision for the layout and craft their brand identity
              from the ground up.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="solution">
          <h4>&amp; The Solution</h4>
            <p>Atlas aims to improve productivity by allowing the user to switch between profiles
              seamlessly and by providing more options and intelligent features. Atlas
              allows users to easily collaborate with peers, colleagues, teachers and
              mentors all across the world and serves as a hub for individuals who
              need a central place to store and create content and collaborate.</p>

              <h5>1. Create a niche<h5>
              <h5>2. Provide brand new options or features<h5>
              <h5>3. Make sure the app is intuitive and seamless to use  on mobile</h5>

          <p>After this initial round of testing and structuring the site design,
            I started piecing together brand elements.
            I created a moodboard of imagery in line with the vision to determine the
            unique qualities of the app.
          </p>
          <p>The words that came to the forefront were vibrant, curious, creative and expressive.
          </p>
          <p>This app was named to hark back to the myth of Atlas supporting the
            world on his back, tos signal it is a platform that will support the
            user’s in all of their endeavors.</p>

            symbolizing illumination and truth. </p>
          <p>The logo is meant to be illustrative
              of the user embracing a creative thought or spark.</p>
          <p>I wanted the logo to feel modern and expressive.</p>

            </figure>
          <p>I changed the design and feel of the logo based on feedback from
            a:b testing. I toned down the visual impact with a
            softer look for the text, lowercase and lighter weight, and a more
            visually subtle icon of a globe, placed to the right.</p>

        <p>Avenir Next is a sans-serif typeface, inspired by the geometric style

        <p>I removed the taskbar on the left and added a toggle switch at the top.
          This toggle is another common iOS element. The majority chose Option B.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>The platform unfolded and evolved based on what was revealed through each phase
            of the UX cycle.</p>
          <p>Through clarifying expectations, and allowing the users to guide the development cycle, I believe I was
            able to deliver a design that satisfied both stakeholder and user
            concerns and desires.</p>
          <p>In hindsight, I would have tested users even more frequently while
            iterating through designs to narrow in further on customization
            options and intelligent features to help Atlas stand out from the
            competitors. Ultimately, the prototype is a starting point.</p>
          <p>To continue supporting the client, I'll develop a cohesive design system
            to enable the in-house designer to make changes
            and adjustments across the entire platform. This design system would
            be a living file to share with
            the client so they have a framework of their own, beyond the
            style guide, for building their brand.</p>
